In this project I see how well we can predict the probability of a Recession within 3 years using 10 Yr - 3Mo Treasury Yield Spread and Unemployment Rate as predictors. These two indicators were mentioned in a recent Forbes article (https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2020/02/24/what-is-the-best-recession-indicator) as great predictors for a recession and I wanted to take a look for myself. In the Jupyter notebook included here, I source the data from the Federal Reserve API, wrangle it, perform EDA, and fit/test a Logistic Regression and a Gradient Boosting model for this purpose.
